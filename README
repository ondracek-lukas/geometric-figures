      The Geometric Figures was created to draw polytopes of any dimension,
      in addition it can generate their convex hull
      and much more via Python plug-ins.

To compile and execute the application you will need:
  Standard Linux components (GNU make, gcc, sed, ...)
  Gawk
  Perl 5.10
  OpenGL, GLU, Freeglut 3.0
  Python 2.7
On debian: gawk, perl, freeglut3, freeglut3-dev, python2.7, python2.7-dev

To cross-compile the application for Windows you will also need:
  unix2dos command (dos2unix package)
  Mingw32
  Freeglut library for windows (freeglut.dll),
    see http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
    and http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
  Python 2.7 for Windows, namely (after installation):
    python27.dll located in C:\Windows\System32
    header files located in C:\Python27\include


Compiling native binaries:
  make [compile]
    Compiles native binaries into bin directory
  make package
    Creates tar.gz package of native binaries in pkg directory
  make clean-tmp
    Removes all temporary created files (obj, ...)
  make clean
    Removes all generated files

Cross-compiling:
  make (compile|package|clean-tmp|clean) arch=(32|64|win32)
    Performs given operation with i686, x64 or windows binaries.
    (Uses directory/file suffixes 32, 64, -win32.)
    For windows, zip package is being created.
  make (compile|package|clean-tmp|clean)-all
    Performs given operation with all three architectures at once.


See:
  VERSION for current version of the application
  COPYING for full text of GNU General Public Licence version 3


There is no complete documentation of the source files,
the most useful are comments in the header files.

A brief documentation of the application can be obtained by typing :help in it
or by reading appropriate source in src/stringsData directory.
Default settings can be read directly from geometric_figures.conf file
located in src/binFiles or in generated bin directory.

Other information (like Czech user_guide) can be found on my web page
  http://ondracek-lukas.hys.cz/projects .
